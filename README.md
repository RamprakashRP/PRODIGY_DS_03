# PRODIGY_DS_03: Building a Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

## Task Overview

**Task 3:** Developing a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer purchase behavior.

## Objective

The main objective of this task is to design and implement a decision tree classifier that can accurately predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service. This prediction will be based on a customer's demographic and behavioral data, utilizing the Bank dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

**Dataset Used:** UCI Machine Learning Repository's Bank dataset.

**Steps:**
- **Loading the Dataset:** Import the Bank dataset into the working environment.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **Data Transformation:** Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalize or standardize the features to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:** Understand the dataset by exploring its structure, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into the relationships between features.

**Steps:**
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics to understand the distribution of features.
- **Visualizations:** Use visual tools such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to identify trends and patterns in the data.
- **Feature Relationships:** Analyze the relationships between demographic and behavioral features and the target variable (purchase decision).

### 3. Building the Decision Tree Classifier

**Objective:** Develop a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchases.

**Steps:**
- **Model Selection:** Choose the decision tree algorithm from a suitable library (e.g., Scikit-learn).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model's parameters (e.g., max depth, min samples split) to improve performance.
- **Model Training:** Train the decision tree classifier using the processed dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 4. Model Testing and Validation

**Objective:** Validate the model's effectiveness using a separate test dataset.

**Steps:**
- **Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
- **Cross-Validation:** Perform k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
- **Performance Metrics:** Analyze the model's performance using the test dataset and report metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score.

### 5. Interpretation and Insights

**Objective:** Interpret the results and derive actionable insights.

**Steps:**
- **Decision Tree Visualization:** Visualize the decision tree to understand the decision-making process.
- **Feature Importance:** Identify the most influential features in predicting customer purchases.
- **Business Implications:** Translate the model's findings into actionable insights for business decision-making.

### 6. Documentation and Reporting

**Objective:** Document the entire process and prepare a comprehensive report.

**Steps:**
- **Code Documentation:** Ensure all code is well-documented with comments and explanations.
- **Technical Report:** Prepare a detailed report covering the methodology, analysis, model development, results, and conclusions.
- **Presentation:** Create a presentation to communicate the findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn:** Used for building and evaluating the decision tree classifier.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

## Conclusion

By completing this task, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of building and evaluating a decision tree classifier for customer purchase prediction. The insights gained from this project will contribute to making data-driven decisions in marketing and customer relationship management.
